The Carebot crew, [Livia](http://twitter.com/livlab) and [Matt](http://twitter.com/matth) (we'll miss you [Brian](http://twitter.com/brianboyer)!), will be at [NICAR](http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar2016/) in Denver, CO this March 9-13. Hit them up if you'd like to learn more about Carebot, see example and ask questions.

### Want to talk about meaningful metrics for journalism?

On Friday, March 11 Matt will facilitate [a discussion](http://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2198/2513/) under the conversations track on this very topic! Bring your ideas and good manners to explore things like:

* What's success in journalism? From the perspective of the end user, the journalist, the news organization, the industry. Are these very different definitions? Are they hard/easy to assess? 
* Is every piece of journalism comparable to another piece of journalism? Are there metrics used to determine success/performance for a piece of journalism applicable to all formats of storytelling? 
* What metrics are you using today and what do they tell you? 
* What are things you want to know but have no answers to because there are no ways to measures the answer? 
* What metrics (measures and indicators) are used in your work setting; which ones make sense and why, and how some can be inappropriate/misleading. 
* What tools/sources do you use to access metrics? How do they fit with your workflow?

Be there!
